# Carbon Footprint Tracker - Data Analysis

## Project Description
> - This project aims to analyze the carbon emissions of various industries across the globe and track their carbon footprint. The project uses multiple datasets related to fossil fuel emissions, SITC codes, and industry sectors to calculate carbon emissions in tons. The data has been grouped and structured according to industry sectors and normalized to track the carbon footprint of each sector.

## Datasets Used
- The following datasets were used in this project:

> - [Climate Trace](https://climatetrace.org/downloads)
> - [Product level carbon intensities](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/productlevelembodiedCO2_Sato2014EE.xls)
> - [ResourceTradeEarth](https://resourcetrade.earth/)

## Industry sector-wise data for carbon emissions
